# Actions Folder

The `actions/` directory is a crucial part of our Next.js application architecture, designed to handle server-side operations and data mutations. This README outlines the key principles and conventions for working with actions in our project.

## Key Principles

1. **Server-Side Operations**: Actions are server-side functions that handle data mutations, form submissions, and other server-side operations.

2. **Type-Safe Inputs**: We use Zod schemas to validate and type-check action inputs, ensuring data integrity and type safety.

3. **Standardized Responses**: Actions return standardized `ActionResponse` objects, providing consistent error handling and data structures across the application.

4. **Error Handling**: Actions implement robust error handling, catching and processing errors to return user-friendly messages in the `ActionResponse`.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: Actions focus solely on server-side logic, separating concerns from client-side components and hooks.

## Best Practices

- Use the `createSafeActionClient` utility to create type-safe actions with Zod schema validation.
- Keep action functions focused and modular.
- Use TypeScript for strong typing of action inputs and outputs.
- Document each action with clear JSDoc comments.
- Implement consistent error handling patterns across all actions.
- Regularly review and update actions to ensure they align with the latest application requirements and API changes.

By adhering to these principles and practices, we maintain a robust and type-safe server-side action layer in our Next.js application.
