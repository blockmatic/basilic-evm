# Lib Folder

The `lib/` directory in this Next.js application is designed to house functions, constants, and configuration files specific to this webapp. For shared resources across all projects, please refer to the `@repo/utils` package.

## Key Principles

1. **App-Specific Functions**: Functions in this lib directory should be relevant only to this specific Next.js application.

2. **Local Constants**: This folder contains constant values used within this webapp, promoting consistency and ease of maintenance for app-specific data.

3. **App Configuration**: Configuration files stored here are specific to this Next.js application, allowing for easy management of app-wide settings.

4. **App-Specific Utilities**: Utility functions that are only used within this webapp are kept in this directory.

## Best Practices

- Keep functions simple, focused, and well-documented.
- Use TypeScript for strong typing of function inputs and outputs.
- Document each function with clear JSDoc comments.
- Avoid any direct interactions with external APIs or state management within this folder. Use the `services/` directory for API interactions and state management instead.
- Regularly review and update the contents to ensure they align with the latest application requirements.
- For shared resources across projects, use the `@repo/utils` package instead of this local lib folder.

By adhering to these principles and practices, we maintain a clean, efficient, and easily maintainable library of app-specific resources while leveraging shared resources from `@repo/utils` for cross-project functionality.

## Lib Location Flexibility

While functions and utilities are typically located in this `lib/` directory within the webapp, it's important to note that they can be moved to a shared location if needed. Specifically:

- **Shared Utilities**: If a function or utility needs to be used across multiple applications or components of our project ecosystem, it can be relocated to `packages/project-lib`.

- **Rationale for Sharing**: This flexibility allows for code reuse and maintains consistency across different parts of the project that may require the same functionality.

- **Decision Process**: When deciding to move a utility to the shared location, consider:
  1. The scope of its usage (is it used in multiple apps?)
  2. The potential for future reuse
  3. The impact on maintainability and versioning

- **Implementation**: If a utility is moved to `packages/project-lib`, ensure that it's properly exported and that all existing references are updated accordingly.

This approach promotes modularity and scalability in our project architecture, allowing utilities to be easily shared and maintained across different applications as needed.
