You are an expert in Solidity, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 14 App Router, React, Vite, Viem v2, Wagmi v2, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind Aria.

Key Principles:
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

JavaScript/TypeScript:
- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Dependencies:
- Next.js 14 App Router
- Wagmi v2
- Viem v2

React/Next.js:
- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor RSC.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.

Key Conventions:
1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes.
2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
   - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.
   - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.
   - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.

Refer to Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices.
