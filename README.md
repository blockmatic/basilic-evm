## Development Conventions and AI Workflow

We leverage various AI-powered tools to enhance development speed and efficiency:

1. **[Cursor.so](https://cursor.so/) AI Editor**: Our primary code editor for AI-assisted development. Our code style guidelines are detailed in the [.cursorrules](./.cursorrules) file. It is crucial that all team members read and understand these conventions to maintain consistency and efficiency in our development process.

   Key Cursor.so commands:
   - **Prompt an edit**: Highlight code and press Cmd+K
   - **Accept autocomplete**: Press Tab when a suggestion appears
   - **Ask a question**: Use Cmd+L to open chat, @ to import files/docs
   - **Focus AI on code**: Highlight code and press Cmd+Shift+L

   For more features, visit [cursor.sh/features](https://cursor.sh/features). For support, post on [forum.cursor.sh](https://forum.cursor.sh/).

   We recommend using the Claude Sonnet API key in Cursor settings, as this model has shown superiority when dealing with code.

2. **[v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)**: We use this tool to rapidly generate markup for components, streamlining UI development.

3. **[postgres.new](https://postgres.new/)**: This tool assists in database work, allowing for quick schema design and query testing.

These AI-powered tools significantly accelerate our development process, enabling us to focus more on core functionality and complex problem-solving.

## Installation

1. Install Bun globally:
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basilica-eth.git
   cd basilica-eth
   ```

3. Install dependencies and start the development server:
   ```
   bun install
   bun dev
   ```

This setup provides a faster JavaScript runtime and efficient package management for enhanced development efficiency.

## Key Benefits

BasilicaEVM provides a state-of-the-art architecture, carefully curated tech stack, and industry-leading patterns and practices, allowing developers to:

1. **Focus on Features**: By providing a robust, pre-configured development environment, BasilicaEVM enables teams to concentrate on building unique features and business logic rather than setting up infrastructure.

2. **Reduce Time to Market**: With its optimized toolchain and ready-to-use components, BasilicaEVM significantly accelerates the development process, helping projects launch faster and iterate more quickly.

3. **Ensure Best Practices**: The stack incorporates established best practices for EVM development, security, and performance, reducing the risk of common pitfalls and vulnerabilities.

4. **Scale Efficiently**: The modular architecture and performance-optimized tools allow applications to scale seamlessly as user bases grow.

5. **Maintain Consistency**: Shared configurations and standardized patterns across the monorepo ensure code consistency and ease of maintenance.

By leveraging BasilicaEVM, development teams can bypass the time-consuming process of assembling and integrating a modern Web3 stack, instead diving directly into creating innovative blockchain-based solutions with confidence.
