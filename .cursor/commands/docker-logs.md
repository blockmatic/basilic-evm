Tail logs from Docker containers to check for errors and monitor application behavior.

1. **Discover running containers**: List all running containers to see what's available using `docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Image}}"`
2. **Ask which containers**: Present list and ask which container(s) they want to monitor
3. **Ask for filters**: Ask if they want any filters (errors only, last N lines, since time, etc.)
4. **Execute command**: Run `docker logs` with suitable flags based on their needs
